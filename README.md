rel="logo" Module for Drupal 7.x
================================

From the website (www.relogo.org):

>rel="logo" is a proposed standard for serving and maintaining up-to-date logos 
>for use in various media. By including a line of code on your site that links 
>to a scalable vector logo, you make it very easy for other websites, applications, 
>readers, clients, and stations to ensure that they are using an approved logo 
>directly from you.
>
>rel="logo" is a link relation tag, much like commonly used icon tags favicon or 
>apple-touch-icon.

This module implements the rel="logo" standard so that it can be easily included in
most drupal sites.
